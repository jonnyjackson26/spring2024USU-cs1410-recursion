# Recursion Exercises - CS 1410

This repository contains various recursion-based assignments and exercises for the CS 1410 course. The implemented functions include:

- Summing elements in an array.
- Finding the minimum value in an array.
- Checking if a sequence of words forms a symmetric pattern.
- Computing weights in a pyramid structure.
- Counting and labeling organisms in a 2D grid image.

These exercises demonstrate the use of recursion to solve typical problems encountered in computer science.
